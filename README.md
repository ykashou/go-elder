# Go-Elder Monorepo

A comprehensive Golang-based implementation of Elder Theory with hierarchical artificial intelligence architecture.

## Architecture Overview

The Go-Elder monorepo implements a multi-level hierarchical system:

- **Elder Entities**: Highest-level entities managing universal principles and gravitational field generation
- **Mentor Entities**: Domain-specific entities handling knowledge transfer across modalities (audio, vision, language)
- **Erudite Entities**: Task-specific entities performing specialized learning and inference

## Directory Structure

### Internal Packages (`internal/`)

#### Core Hierarchical Components
- `go-elder/`: Elder entity implementation with gravitational generation and universal principles
- `go-mentor/`: Mentor entities with domain knowledge management and erudite orchestration
